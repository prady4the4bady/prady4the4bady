**Welcome!** I'm building a premium, 3D-enhanced GitHub profile page — this repo hosts the demo site and profile README.

## Interactive demo

Click the link below to open the interactive 3D demo (hosted with GitHub Pages):

👉 https://prady4the4bady.github.io/prady4the4bady/

> Note: It can take a minute after the first deploy for GitHub Pages to become active. If the page doesn't appear right away, give it a few moments and refresh.

## What you'll find here

- `docs/index.html` — the interactive demo using `model-viewer` (3D model, camera controls, and auto-rotate). 🔧
- `assets/preview.svg` — a lightweight animated SVG preview used in this README. ✨
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` — GitHub Action to publish `docs/` to GitHub Pages on each push to `main`. 🚀

## Design notes

- Style: premium with deep/dark background and accent glow.
- 3D: `model-viewer` provides accessible camera controls and a fast integration path.

## How to preview locally

1. Clone the repo
2. Open `docs/index.html` in a browser (no build step required)

## Want changes?

Tell me what color palette, 3D model, or animation preferences you want and I’ll iterate the design.

Made with ❤️ — *If you'd like, I can add an animated GIF preview generated from the demo and polish the Pages deploy.*
